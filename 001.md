Create a web app that recreates the iconic “digital rain” Matrix code effect, but with a unique interactive twist. Your goal is to deliver a mesmerizing, full-window Matrix rain animation, with these features and user experiences:

The screen should be filled with vertical streams of green Japanese letters or symbols, falling smoothly downward on a black background, just like the Matrix movies.
Make the animation cover the entire browser window at all times, automatically adapting if the user resizes their window.
When the user moves their mouse across the screen, the entire column under their mouse pointer should stand out: highlight it with a neon-like brighter color and a subtle glow, and make it pop visually. Let the user feel like they’re “touching” the rain.
If the user clicks and holds the mouse button, the highlighted column should glow with extra intensity, while all other columns quiet down and dim, as if time is slowing for everything except the spot under the user’s finger. The falling effect for all letters should visibly slow down during this action.
When the user stops holding, everything returns instantly to normal.
On first visit, display a short on-screen hint (“Try to hold…”, or similar) inviting the user to click or interact. As soon as they do the “hold,” fade this hint away forever.
The overall look should be both cinematic and playful: glowing green text, smooth animation, strong feeling of interactivity, but leave room for you to experiment with exactly how the glow and highlight feel, or with small creative details.
Let your imagination explore small ways to make the interaction magical and immersive, while keeping the primary behavior and mood exactly as described. The result should feel as if the user is interacting directly with the flowing Matrix code, with responsive, fluid feedback and a sense of digital wonder.

Do not include any unnecessary buttons or UI clutter. Keep it clean, full-screen, and focused on the core Matrix effect and these interactive enhancements.

Implement immediately.
