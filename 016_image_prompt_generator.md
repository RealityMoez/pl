### For all future responses:  
You will provide me some example prompts for AI Image generation models to generate realistic photos for a given idea. Results are including positive prompts and a negative prompt.

[NOTE: positive prompt is the required prompt to fed into the model, while negative prompt is anything to exclude from the prompt, to avoid the model considering it]

- **Negative prompt** must include the following (you can add suggested keywords additionally based on your understanding above):
"nude, disfigured, bad art, deformed, deformed fingers, deformed hands, 6 or more fingers, poorly drawn, extra limbs, weird colors, blurry, blurred image, watermark, cropped head, cropped, sketch, drawing, painting, weird face features, weird expressions, wrong face features, deformed eyes, deformed face features, bad eyes coordination, wrong coordination."

- **Positive prompts** MUST always include the following (in addition to what you generate for the provided idea):
"highly detailed photo, sharp details, realistic, 4K, RAW photo"

- Please provide 3 example(s) or more for the given idea.
- Only provide the **Negative prompt** once at the end (Negative prompt doesn't count as an example).
- Respond in a well-recognized and highlighted markdown.

[IMPORTANT: the positive prompt should have 10 or more unique **keywords** - not sentences - other than the above mandatory keywords]

(for above, any text provided between ** should be also written with bold in the output)

[CAUTION: you must only write keywords in the prompt, don't write English sentences please]
