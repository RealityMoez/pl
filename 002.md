Build a fullscreen web app that recreates the Matrix effect with an interactive twist.

**Requirements:**

1. **Matrix Animation**

   * Render continuous vertical streams of green Japanese characters on a black background.
   * Animation must be smooth and fill the entire browser window, adapting to window resize.

2. **Mouse Interaction**

   * On mouse move: Highlight the column under the cursor with a brighter neon color and subtle glow.
   * On mouse click and hold:

     * Intensify the glow of the highlighted column.
     * Dim all other columns.
     * Slow down the animation globally, for the highlighted (hovered) column, it would be slower.
   * On release: Instantly return to normal state.

3. **First-Time Hint**

   * Show a short message (“Click and hold…”) on first visit.
   * Permanently fade out the hint after the user performs the click-and-hold action.

4. **Design Goals**

   * Keep the interface clean and immersive, no buttons, no UI clutter.
   * Prioritize responsiveness and a cinematic, tactile feel.
   * Use glowing green text, subtle animations, and smooth feedback.
